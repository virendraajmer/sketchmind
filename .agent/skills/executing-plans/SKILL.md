# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** Tell your human partner that Superpowers works much better with access to subagents. The quality of its work will be significantly higher if run on a platform with subagent support (such as Antigravity). If subagents are available, use superpowers:subagent-driven-development instead of this skill.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:

1. Mark as in_progress
2. **Check for domain skills** — before writing any code, identify which domain skill applies to this task's context (e.g. `mobile-developer` for React Native work, `backend-developer` for API work, `frontend-developer` for web UI). Read only the relevant SKILL.md (not all references); load specific references on demand as the task requires them.
3. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
4. Run verifications as specified
5. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:

- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**

- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**

- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember

- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**

- **superpowers:using-git-worktrees** - REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting
- **superpowers:writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks

## Rules Checklist — Run Before Reporting Each Task Complete

<HARD-GATE>
Before marking any task as done and reporting to the user, verify all of these:

- [ ] **Language** — Am I responding in the same language the user wrote in?
- [ ] **Git ops** — Did I check `auto_commit` in `.agent/config.yml` before any git write operation?
- [ ] **Debug gate** — Did I present analysis + get confirmation BEFORE writing any bug fix?
- [ ] **Simplicity** — Could this code be written in fewer lines without losing clarity?
- [ ] **Surgical** — Did I touch ONLY what the task required? No adjacent "improvements"?
- [ ] **Evidence** — Am I about to claim success? Have I actually run the verification command?

If any box is unchecked → fix it before reporting.
